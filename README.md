Used a template for the base of the website

Individual contributions:

Katriel - I found the website template to use for the website. I coded the shopping cart, login page, contact us page, payment page, payment successful page, the JSON file and changed the information on the home page. I found the animations to put into the websites and coded them in along with the proper CSS styling to make it suit the website and look appealing to the users. 

Yi Ting - I coded the part to make the "Add to cart" button fit nicely into the layout and found some images to put in the website. I also coded the part where each of the products are linked to their own page, so that there isn't a lot of different files just for the individual products. I coded the About Us page and changed the layout to suit the website.
